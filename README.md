Hadoop development test 

#Task 

The following tasks are required. The output from each should be clearly separated, although the exact separation character is up to you (for example, you may choose to separate each output with a newline character).<br>
Output the number of unique words that appear in the input. For example, with the input text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy<br>
1. Dog", there are 8 unique words.<br>
Output a list of all unique words that appear in the input, sorted alphabetically. For the purposes of this step, you may output the words in lower case, if desired.<br>
3. Determine if any of the unique words are palindromes. If so, print out a list of the words that are. For the purposes of this step, you may input the words in lower case, if desired Output the average number of letters in each word in the input. For example, with the input text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy<br>
4. Dog", the average number of letters in each word is 3.89.<br>
5. For each sentence in the input, output the reverse. You may collapse any whitespace between sentences into a single space. For example, with the input text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The lazy dog jumps over the quick brown fox", the output should be "god yzal eht revo spmuj xof nworb kciuq ehT. xof nworb kciuq eht revo spmuj god yzal ehT"<br>
